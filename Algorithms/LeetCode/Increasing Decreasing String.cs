    /* 1370. Increasing Decreasing String
     * 
     * Given a string s. You should re-order the string using the following algorithm:
     * 
     *     Pick the smallest character from s and append it to the result.
     *     Pick the smallest character from s which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
     *     Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
     *     Pick the largest character from s and append it to the result.
     *     Pick the largest character from s which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
     *     Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
     *     Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from s.
     * 
     * In each step, If the smallest or the largest character appears more than once you can choose any occurrence and append
     * it to the result.
     * 
     * Return the result string after sorting s with this algorithm.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: s = "aaaabbbbcccc"
     * Output: "abccbaabccba"
     * Explanation: After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the first iteration, result = "abc"
     * After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the first iteration, result = "abccba"
     * First iteration is done. Now s = "aabbcc" and we go back to step 1
     * After steps 1, 2 and 3 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabc"
     * After steps 4, 5 and 6 of the second iteration, result = "abccbaabccba"
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: s = "rat"
     * Output: "art"
     * Explanation: The word "rat" becomes "art" after re-ordering it with the mentioned algorithm.
     * 
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: s = "leetcode"
     * Output: "cdelotee"
     * 
     * Example 4:
     * 
     * Input: s = "ggggggg"
     * Output: "ggggggg"
     * 
     * Example 5:
     * 
     * Input: s = "spo"
     * Output: "ops"
