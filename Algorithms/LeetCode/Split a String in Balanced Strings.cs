    /* 1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings
     * 
     * Balanced strings are those who have equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.
     * Given a balanced string s split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.
     * Return the maximum amount of splitted balanced strings.
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * 
     * Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
     * Output: 3
     * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
     * 
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
     * Output: 1
     * Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
     * 
     * Example 4:
     * 
     * Input: s = "RLRRRLLRLL"
     * Output: 2
     * Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRRLLRLL", since each substring contains an equal number of 'L' and 'R'
