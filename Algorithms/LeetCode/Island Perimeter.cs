    /* 463. Island Perimeter
     * 
     * You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and
     * grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
     * 
     * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely
     * surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
     * 
     * The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around
     * the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height
     * don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island. 
     * 
     * Example 1:
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/
     * Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
     * Output: 16
     * Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
     * 
     * Example 2:
     * 
     * Input: grid = [[1]]
     * Output: 4
     * 
     * Example 3:
     * 
     * Input: grid = [[1,0]]
     * Output: 4
